## Design

### Design Choices
Considering that the website will be mostly visited by men, a simple and straightforward design has been adopted, with little attention to details. Today's men have a full life and little time to waste, so they want to be able to cut their hair without wasting time and any distraction, while keeping up with fashion.

### Colour
For color the simple and masculine style was maintained. ColorSpace was used to generate shades starting from the dark navy color
which is also the colour theme of the actual barber shop.
